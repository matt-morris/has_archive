# HasArchive

This project was born out of frustration with all the options I've found so far for archiving non-current ActiveRecord backed records, so I'm going to give it a go. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'has_archive'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install has_archive

## Usage

TODO: Halp. This is ready for nothing, so far, but if this seems like a useful/worthwhile project to you, please feel free to dig and lend a hand.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
